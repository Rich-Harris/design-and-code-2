## Coding club rules

* **Help each other out.** We have a lot of material to get through, and a lot of new concepts to learn. It'll only work if we collaborate.
* **Phones away.** Unless you're using it for classwork, your phone should be on silent and out of view. Bring your full attention.
* **Ask lots of questions.** There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers. If you're stuck on something, other people probably are too, so do them a favour and raise your hand.
* **Show up!** We start at 6.30pm prompt, which means you should be there at 6.25pm. If you miss a class, you'll drop half a grade. If you're more than 20 minutes late, it's considered an absence.


## Prerequisites

TK – text editor, Chrome, GitHub account etc? Essential/recommended reading


## Grading

Your grade will be calculated based on the following factors:

* 5% – week 2 presentation
* 20% – mid-semester assignment and presentation (in teams)
* 50% – final assignment and presentation

* 75% – based on homework, attendance, punctuality, attitude

**Assignment** scores are based on creativity, originality, and technical execution. Strive to create interesting, thought-provoking, visually appealing projects that work well on mobile devices. (Don't worry, you'll learn how!) Plagiarism or any other form of academic dishonesty will be severely penalized.

**Presentation** scores are based on preparation & timekeeping, interestingness, and the subsequent Q&A. Show the rest of the class something surprising that makes us an enthusiastic about the subject as you are, and don't be afraid to use humor.
