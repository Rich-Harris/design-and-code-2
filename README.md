## Coding club rules

* **Help each other out.** We have a lot of material to get through, and a lot of new concepts to learn. It'll only work if we collaborate.
* **Phones away.** Unless you're using it for classwork, your phone should be on silent and out of view. Bring your full attention.
* **Ask lots of questions.** There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers. If you're stuck on something, other people probably are too, so do them a favour and raise your hand.
* **Show up!** We start at 6.30pm prompt, which means you should be there at 6.25pm. If you miss a class, you'll drop half a grade. If you're more than 20 minutes late, it's considered an absence.


## Prerequisites

TK – text editor, Chrome, GitHub account etc?


## Grading

Your grade will be calculated based on the following factors:

* 5% – week 2 presentation
* 20% – mid-semester assignment and presentation (in teams)
* 50% – final assignment and presentation

* 75% – based on homework, attendance, punctuality, attitude

**Assignment** scores are based on creativity, originality, and technical execution. Strive to create interesting, thought-provoking, visually appealing projects that work well on mobile devices. (Don't worry, you'll learn how!) Plagiarism or any other form of academic dishonesty will be severely penalized.

**Presentation** scores are based on preparation & timekeeping, interestingness, and the subsequent Q&A. Show the rest of the class something surprising that makes us an enthusiastic about the subject as you are, and don't be afraid to use humor.


## Week by Week

### 1. 25 Jan

* **Lecture** What is coding, and what is it not?
* **Discussion** What is interactive web-based storytelling good for?
* **Workshop** Create your first interactive web page


* **Homework** Find an example of interactive web-based storytelling and prepare a three-minute critique to present to the class in week two. Focus on novel uses of web technologies and the way they succeed (or fail!) in enhancing the story. ‘Storytelling’ is deliberately vague – it could be a piece of journalism, advocacy, art, advertising...
