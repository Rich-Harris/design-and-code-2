# Libraries worth learning

## Basic utilities

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) – lots of utilities for manipulating the DOM, handling user interactions, making AJAX requests, etc. *Everyone* learns jQuery when they're learning JavaScript
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) – sometimes referred to as JavaScript's missing [standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library). Contains a lot of functions that you'd probably end up writing yourself

## Dataviz

* [d3](https://d3js.org/) – *data driven documents*. Difficult but very powerful library with lots of examples available for adaptation
* [Chroma](http://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) – create, convert, and manipulate colors

## Mapping

* [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/) – for creating Google Maps-style slippy maps. (You'll sometimes hear people recommend Leaflet for this; don't listen to them, it's dying. The author of Leaflet is now working for Mapbox)
* [Tangram](https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram) – more flexible than Mapbox GL but probably somewhat harder (I haven't used it yet)

## 3D/WebGL

* [Three](http://threejs.org/) – the most user-friendly 3D library, which isn't saying much... not for the faint-hearted, but it allows you to make some really cool stuff
* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) – for building VR scenes. Haven't tried it yet but it looks interesting

## Web audio

* [Tone](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) – for making music. I haven't tried this yet but it looks really cool!

## Time and dates

* [Moment](http://momentjs.com/) – parse and manipulate dates

## Touchscreen

* [Hammer](http://hammerjs.github.io/) – for detecting e.g. swipe gestures on touchscreen

## General app development

* [Ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org/) – what we use at the Guardian (full disclosure: I wrote it!)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) – very popular library made by Facebook. Has a bit of a learning curve attached to it
