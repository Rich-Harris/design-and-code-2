# Recommended reading/watching

* **Neil Postman** – Amusing Ourselves to Death. Very readable book that primes you to think about some of the McLuhan-esque questions that arise from the emergence of pervasive interactive digital media
* **Paul Ford** – [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). Epic, entertaining dive into the history and culture of coding. Helps you to understand where JavaScript fits alongside everything else
* **Bret Victor** – [Media for Thinking the Unthinkable](http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/). Everything Bret Victor does is worth careful study – this video in particular explores some of the possibilities of interactive media (though his focus is on science rather than storytelling)
* **Edward Tufte** – The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. The dataviz bible.
* **Nigel Holmes** – [Using humor to inform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB7DCEayj3w). A counterpoint to some of what Tufte says. Conference videos are a good way to keep up with trends and developments in dataviz – this one comes from [OpenVis conf 2015](https://openvisconf.com/2015/).
