  "text": "IT was the last night of our honeymoon, and we were making soup with lobster, shrimp and crab — not a meal for someone who, like me, had been sent to the emergency room by a dish of crab Rangoon two weeks earlier. On this trip, I had eaten a lot of shellfish but no crab Rangoon, and the swelling, itching and rapidly closing throat had not returned. I hoped to continue my luck, but I suspected this new allergy was not as limited as I had hoped. \n\nAs we ate, Steve watched me for signs. I was watching him, too. It was true I should have been more cautious with seafood, but it was also true that he should have been more cautious with the beers we had just opened and the gin and tonics we had sipped beforehand.\n\nA month earlier, we had been playing pool in a bar with a guy we had just met when suddenly Steve’s voice grew louder, his jokes duller. The other pool player quietly walked away. I realized Steve was drunk. Not the pleasant sensory-laden buzz of a few drinks after work, but sloppily, mortifyingly drunk. \n\nIn all the years I had known him, including college, I had rarely seen him like this. Yet this was now the second time in weeks he had been out of control. I thought I knew what he had been drinking, but maybe he had ordered shots when I wasn’t looking. Much later he would tell me he had begun every evening with a big head start. My first beer might be his seventh.\n\nThere was no reason he drank so much, he later told me. No secret grief, no special fear over the wedding. It just happened. \n\nI knew this was trouble. Alcoholism ran through the men in his family like blue eyes and the shape of their noses. I asked myself if I was really going to do what, perhaps, I ought to: cancel the wedding, leave him. But was I going to dump someone after six years because he got drunk?\n\nI didn’t cancel the wedding, but there were other mishaps. At the barbecue where we began telling friends of our engagement, Steve got food poisoning,  and later I announced our news to my family while he stayed home, moaning on the bathroom floor and croaking weak but affable thanks when my parents phoned him. \n\nAnd then in August, the day after we married (and a few weeks before our delayed honeymoon), that crab Rangoon swelled my throat closed. \n\nWe joked that these were omens; we mocked the way our milestones were attended by vomiting and emergency rooms. And with hubris we planned for our honeymoon, on the Delaware Shore, to be nothing less than a shellfish extravaganza. \n\nTo us the ocean was less a place to swim than a vast buffet. Our first night in town, smelling the salt and kelp in the air, we ordered blue crabs dredged in fiery reddish-orange seasoning, dumping a pile of them onto a newspaper-covered picnic table. It was my favorite kind of seafood: a meal you ate with your hands until your fingers and mouth burned. We drank a pitcher of cold, pale beer from plastic cups. Steve was peaceful, happy. He didn’t drink too much, and I was beginning to relax again. As we ate, we planned the week’s meals — all shellfish.\n\n I made the pretense of caution, pausing as I started each meal to gauge any reactions. I was supposed to carry a couple of EpiPens but kept forgetting. Who really carried medicine everywhere they went? Who worried that way? I had never believed that all those things really applied to me.\n\n And we kept getting away with it: meal after meal, I ate seafood without consequence and Steve drank wine or beer like a normal person. Though he would stop me as we left the beach house to be sure I had my EpiPens and question whether we should order blue crab by the pound, I chose to see this as someone sweetly trying out the new role of husband and worrier, not as legitimate warnings.\n\nTHAT last night, Steve sat back and watched as I took the first bite of seafood soup. It was sort of a ritual: the slow chew, the thoughtful inventory of my responses. Was that sunburn or the first ominous, tentative itch of my skin? I was slightly flushed, but it might have been the warmth in the porch or the pleasure over the honeymoon, the meal. Did my lips feel numb, did my scalp tingle? Maybe, but the soup was peppery. The sensory recall of that one attack was fading already. \n\n“Well?” Steve asked. \n\nI ate a clam. It was a little on the chewy side, but I didn’t mind. “I think I’m fine.”\n\n“Maybe we should have gotten wine,” Steve said. “The soup kind of deserves it.” \n\nWe were both quiet, disappointed we had neglected the proper wine. I liked talking about what wine we should have, what went with which dish. I didn’t want to give that up, either. I stirred my soup until I found a lobster claw, the perfect shape of the meat still mimicking its lost shell, and ate it all at once.\n\nNothing happened. The allergy would lay dormant, resting up, for another six months. I was certain I must have dodged a bullet — surely it was all a mistake. Every time I lucked out it was pure relief, even delight, to be able to have what I wanted, as much as I wanted. \n\nWe opened the extra beer because we didn’t have to drive and didn’t care about hangovers. We lighted more candles and played strip poker. I talked about squeezing in one more paper tablecloth full of blue crabs before we drove back to New York the next day to start new jobs and new schools and settle into a new apartment. \n\nLater that winter, after months of eating seafood like anyone else, a shellfish meal at a tapas restaurant proved the final straw for my dithering immune system, which decided on “allergic” once and for all. As I lay in a bed at Beth Israel Hospital, hooked up to IV’s and monitors, I recalled the way I had almost confused sunburn or the heat of a few chilies for the first symptoms of anaphylactic shock. \n\nIt turned out there was no mistaking the real thing. This time my hair stood on end. The tingling that ranged over my skin was electric, almost crackling; my mouth swelled and numbed so thoroughly that I felt my own face as meat. In the hospital I finally understood the obvious, that vacations full of seafood were an impossibility for me. But at the beach that summer I didn’t yet believe in such an insurmountable problem. We had been married for two weeks. \n\nThe last meal of our honeymoon was perfect, it was true, but we missed the luck part of the equation. We thought it was our doing. We had changed almost everything in our lives, thrown our lot together. The surplus of cash from the wedding gave us a taste of what a little wealth might feel like. The sea had washed our new rings so clean they sparkled. The filaments at the edges of Steve’s lashes and eyebrows were bright gold from the sun.\n\nYou couldn’t have guessed, looking at him, that he would turn into someone totally different, someone whose eyes would go as dead as a trout’s, who within a few years would stumble in long after work without looking at me. I could not have known he would someday emerge from a blackout to find himself walking along a rural highway 20 miles north of our house, still carrying his briefcase. But I think he knew, even then, that something like that was on its way.\n\nFive years later, we live more like monks: our herbal tea after dinner, the endless seltzer. I don’t touch shellfish. We no longer have a special wine with an anniversary dinner or beer on a hot afternoon. There is not supposed to be anything alcoholic at all, Steve is supposed to be sober, but in truth it is a cycle. Weeks of sobriety, then the fall. Every month or so it returns, secreted in a briefcase, brought in from the trunk of the car when I’m not home. \n\nWE’RE long past pretending these binges are accidental, or that even a single glass of wine is acceptable. So instead of too much wine at dinner, it’s the bottle in the closet, the thermos tucked among the ceiling tiles. He can hide it for only a day or so. Then we clear the place out, dump the bottles, and the next attempt begins. \n\nMonastic life, if only intermittent, has its benefits, the biggest being that 90 percent of the time I have him back, the person I knew for the first six years. But sometimes I wake in the night, the bed next to me empty.\n\n Steve is home, but he’s on the couch, and I go and stand over him, knowing that he falls asleep out here when he has hidden a bottle and waited till I have gone to bed to get it. In these moments I don’t know what will follow — whether I’ll go to work or call a moving van. We could last 30 more years or it could be one more day. \n\nNow it’s summer again, and I think of that week at the beach fondly, bitterly, as if it were a lost paradise and not a beach like any other. That dinner was glorious because we were being granted a respite before we even understood it. The sharp scent of the flickering candle, the lime on our fingers, the sea-sweet lobster — it was all a mirage, but we actually lived inside it. Nothing existed beyond that little house and the dark, starred beach with its water foaming whitely around our feet, and nothing malevolent came inside its boundaries. We had inklings of what was coming, what circled us even then.\n\n But during that week, that last night, those clues had all receded, or else we simply pushed them back. The future waited, as it always does, melting patiently into the hazy edge of the horizon. "
