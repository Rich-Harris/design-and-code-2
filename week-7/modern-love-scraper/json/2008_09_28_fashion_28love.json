  "text": "MY 79-year-old husband, the love of my life, is having an “affair” with a young single woman named Jenn. He and I fell in love more than a half century ago and have lived together for 22 years, but I have no regrets about the liaison. Go for it, I say. Be my guest. \n\nIn fact, it was Jenn herself, a self-described yogi with anarchist leanings, who told me about the affair after my husband confessed to feeling so guilty about it that he thought the time had come to tell the spouses. \n\nI’m the one who hired her, and I could fire her, but I never will. I need her. When I checked out her references she was invariably described as a free spirit: centered, focused, patient, relaxed. One person said she was so unflappable that no matter what was happening around her she would sit perfectly still meditating for hours on end. \n\nThese are prime qualifications for my husband’s companion, ever since he fell from a sleeping loft four years ago and suffered a traumatic brain injury. He was  catapulted him into a state resembling advanced Alzheimer’s, left  unable to remember anything that happened from then on or to find his way home from across the street. Caring for him requires, as people always tell me, the patience of a saint. \n\nMy husband is a gentleman and a sweetheart. Since his social skills, long-term memory and delight in life are pretty much intact, he is charming and considerate with people he knew before his fall. \n\nBut when a new companion arrives, for the first few weeks, until her face begins to look familiar, the constant presence of a stranger at his elbow can provoke in him such bouts of agitation, cursing (disinhibition) and combativeness that many a potential companion has quit on the second day. \n\n“Today he threw a glass of water in my face,” a recent hire told me in an e-mail message as she took her leave. “This is something I cannot accept, and I will not work with him.” \n\nIn such situations I console myself by noting that the person who reacts with hurt or rage, despite having been told repeatedly that such attacks must never be taken personally, is not the right companion for my husband. \n\nThe drugs sometimes prescribed for these typical symptoms of frontal-lobe brain injury not only do nothing to soothe his agitation, but they also produce terrible side effects — in addition to which, according to recent studies, they work no better than placebos in the elderly. \n\nAs stated in the newspaper report on the largest study, and supported by most handbooks on caring for people with brain disease, the only reliable treatment for agitation like his is patience, calm and understanding. \n\nWhen I asked Jenn at our interview if she thought she’d be able to withstand the shouting, cursing and threats of the early weeks, she said, “I can’t think of much that can ruffle me.” \n\nThe job of Scott’s companion requires that she keep him happy and safe for hours every day, which means accompanying him to cafes, parks, the library, museums — all the places he went by himself before his fall — and never for an instant letting him out of her sight. \n\nIf only I could convince them of the dangers. If only they could know the panic I felt the time I lost him at the Union Square market and, after hours of combing the neighborhood in a police car, found him in the emergency room of St. Vincent’s Hospital, agitated and in pain over three dislocated fingers. A stranger had found him lying on the cobblestones under the West Side Highway beside our empty shopping cart. \n\nOr the time his companion lost him in the lobby of the Metropolitan Museum (which he referred to as his “temple” before his fall) after asking him to wait on a bench while she went to the bathroom, which of course he couldn’t remember.\n\nWhile the museum guards searched in his favorite galleries and I frantically notified the police, he, unaware that anything was amiss, had left the museum and, drawing on long-term memory, hailed a taxi to go home. \n\nI assume he  stiffed the driver because the emergency $20 bill I’d tucked inside his wallet hadn’t been touched. Even though I’d been sick with worry, once he was safely home I felt proud of him for having found his way back on his own.\n\nMost of his companions have been graduate students in the arts or the helping professions whom I found through postings on college Web sites. Jenn was the first person I hired through a popular Internet employment site. \n\nCertain friends I consulted questioned how reliable a free-spirited yogi with anarchist leanings might be, especially one whose average stay on a job, according to her résumé, was under six months. \n\nBut she was signing on only for the summer, and I had a good feeling about her at the interview. I decided to give her a try. \n\nMy experience with new caregivers has left me so gun-shy that I wasn’t prepared for the instant rapport Jenn established with Scott. How did she (or does she) do it? \n\nPerhaps part of her appeal is that they look related: same ruddy skin that sunburns easily, same blondish hair (as his was before it turned white), same tall, slim, athletic build. To a stranger she might appear to be his granddaughter, and to him, she would seem a natural part of his intimate circle, one of the family. \n\nBut I believe her real secret is that she thinks the way he does. For instance, in the  face of daunting Manhattan traffic, instead of reassuring him, as I and his other companions try  to do (unsuccessfully), she — new to New York — shares his fears. \n\nWalking beside him through the crowded streets, she seconds his disgust with smokers and horn blowers, his scorn for police and politicians, as readily as she joins in his passing delight at dachshunds, small children, architecture. \n\nAs far as I can tell, she sincerely agrees with the convictions he’s held since his fall (and now freely expresses) that much of what goes on during an ordinary day is senseless or stupid. Instead of regarding his comments as incoherent rants, as others do, she sees in his dementia a kind of courage: a willingness to call the emperor naked. \n\nThen perhaps it should not have surprised me that before the end of the second week, when other caregivers would barely be starting to earn his trust, she reported that he seemed to believe they were having an affair. She realized what was on his mind when he started speaking of his guilt about their “secret.” \n\nNot that he ever makes sexual advances or overtures toward her. She’s assured me of that, and I believe her. He loves me more than ever, now that he’s dependent. Besides, I’m sure that he, like me, has never been unfaithful, as we were in our earlier marriages.\n\n It’s just that without short-term memory to provide context, the events of daily life must seem incomprehensible or absurd, but being human, he can’t stop trying to make sense of them anyway. \n\nImagination and ingenuity, those hallmarks of our species, are all it takes to explain anything, even a senseless world. From the moment Scott emerged from his drug-induced coma in the hospital, he started trying to explain his strange surroundings, alternately positing that he was in a sports club (seeing Tiger Woods on TV), a library (observing nurses with stacks of binders), a post office, a company headquarters, a hotel, even a French prison. (Noting that a passing male nurse in yellow scrubs looked uniformed, he shouted: “Look out! Here come the gendarmes with their gold braid!”) Any place but a hospital, since, oblivious of his accident, he had no reason to imagine he was in an institution of healing.\n\nStill unaware four years later that anything is wrong with him, how should he explain Jenn’s constant presence? The one time I hired a male companion for him, he was certain that Henry was my lover. Why else would Henry hang around day after day?\n\n Now that my husband’s days are spent in the company of an attractive like-minded young woman who holds his hand wherever they go and acts like a soul mate, what better explanation can there be than that they’re a couple? Even though he doesn’t know, and will never know, her name. No contrary evidence or alternative account presents itself. \n\nBut if they are lovers, then he’s betraying me, on whom he depends for everything — a predicament fraught with danger. \n\nIN his undamaged long-term memory he well recalls the strain that affairs put on his first marriage. When he asks me if I object to his spending so much time with “the people over there” (using a circumlocution characteristic of his disease), I rush to reassure him that not only do I not mind but, on the contrary, I benefit from it. \n\n“Really?” he asks, incredulous, though visibly relieved. But as soon as something reminds him again of his predicament, I see him resume his struggle over whether or not to confess. \n\nSoon, alas, the question will be moot. With summer’s end, Jenn is getting ready to move on, leaving me to deal again with the agitation, foul language and perhaps violence with which Scott will likely test her  replacement. Unless I am lucky enough to find another Jenn. \n\nTo that end, I have modified the “qualifications” section of my postings to include, “free-spirited, centered, focused, patient, relaxed,” adding that “the calm that results from a strong yoga or meditation practice will be counted a definite plus.” \n\nThe magic of attraction that makes a couple click remains ultimately inexplicable, as I am well aware. But like anyone who places a personals ad, I remain ever hopeful that love may strike again."
