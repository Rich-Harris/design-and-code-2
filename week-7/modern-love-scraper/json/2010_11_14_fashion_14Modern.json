We are halfway through “The Hurt Locker.”\n\nWatching a war movie with a combat veteran is an exercise in running commentary in which he points out every half-truth, inconsistency and off-note as the scenes roll by — an incidental soundtrack peppered with profanity. Critique is part of the drill, offered volubly and seriously, almost as a professional obligation. It’s like sitting next to a close-cropped, NC-17-rated   Roger Ebert.\n\nI’ve found out more about my husband’s combat experience from watching war movies with him than from any conversation. \n\nNearly 10 years ago when we started dating, intimacy to me meant full disclosure. I wanted to know everything. I thought I’d gain his trust, he’d tell me every gritty detail, and he would be relieved, as if a wound had been lanced. \n\nI fantasized about us lying under a leafy oak with his head resting in my lap as he unburdened himself. I learned quickly that while he had nothing to hide, he didn’t much want to share, either. It was less like lancing a wound than touching a bruise — it hurt, and there was no help within the hurting. \n\nTalking can relieve pain, but it can also make you relive it. So I stopped asking.\n\nAs we watch these films, I learn. Not from what I see, but from what he says. Certain scenes lead him to reminisce, often about things I never knew.\n\n “This reminds me of the time when my driver and I were surrounded by Iraqis who kept popping out of hide positions in the sand. We fired an antitank rocket to get them to scatter. That’s how I lost the hearing in my right ear.”\n\n “They never send a lone officer to do casualty notification. One guy’s not going to show up and tell you I’d been killed in action.”\n\n “The stuff they’re wearing is ‘MOPP gear.’ We had to put it on whenever the Iraqis would lob missiles over the border.” This last one he said with a cackle. (That’s a soldier for you: That which doesn’t kill him makes him laugh.) \n\nThere have been no great movies about the experience of the military spouse. If there were, I’d make my husband watch. But the cinematic narratives constructed in a wife’s head have their own grim, gripping arc. \n\nWhen my husband was deployed, I repeatedly pictured myself at his funeral, speaking through tears to the sad assemblage in West Point’s Old Cadet Chapel. I mediated the chaos of potential loss by embracing it. Fantasizing about it. Playacting it. \n\nWhat I would do if he were captured. Tortured. Decapitated. I deliberated: Would I want to see the photo of the captors holding his head? What seemed at first like drama-queen mental theatrics, I realized, was a necessary form of processing. Every movie has its ending. The demon of anticipatory grief was asking, “Do you dare envision yours?”\n\nAnd my answer was yes.\n\nBut that was then. Now, as the wife of a veteran who will never face another deployment, I have developed an almost vulgar sensitivity to images of such harm, to the point where I can’t watch combat scenes in movies. \n\n“You never slow your vehicle in an ambush,” my husband says as sounds of enemy fire and breaking glass blare from the TV speakers. Gaze averted, I can scarcely hear him for the adrenaline screeching in my ears. Tears pool in my eyes. Every injury is his injury. Every death is his death. He curses again, noting a mistake in a soldier’s uniform. He corrects to standard, I weep. And there you have it, two halves of a military whole.\n\nApart from the heightened emotional state of deployment, much of the life of a military wife is routine: Waiting for orders. Moving. The stifling civility of covered-dish lunches, hail and farewells at greasy pubs and chain restaurants, which can feel like suburban gilding over so much blood and guts. \n\nLook closely at the potluck warriors, and you’ll notice the chronically bouncing knee. The fourth beer at the unit social function. The laugh that’s a little too tense, too loud. We’ve got a whole lot of soldiers who think that because they’re functioning, they’re not suffering, despite the ample proof of cratered marriages, confused children and a dizzying suicide rate.\n\n It is here that I see the damning effects of silence, its lethal application: in the unwillingness to stare in the face of dysfunction and call it out. This is your patch-and-retread Army, America, lurching forth in the name of appearances with the stoic professionalism of a Cheever drunk.\n\nThere’s a scene at the end of “The Hurt Locker” in which the hazard-junkie protagonist has returned to the United States. He stands bewildered in a supermarket aisle, helpless to choose a cereal from the fully stocked shelves. After more than a year of hard-driving privation, he’s paralyzed by abundance, adrift without the laser-point focus of dangerous duty. \n\nSymbolically, the scene has tremendous heft, though in reality, the fallout of homecoming is less dazed and more punishing, with vehicle accidents, domestic disputes in which words fly on both sides like hot shrapnel, quietly swallowed guilt and day-to-day life buoyed by a smoothing pharmaceutical tide. And no, I don’t miss it.\n\nAnd yet, I do.\n\nWith all its drawbacks — the horror and the tedium, the sublimation and upheaval — what could make being a military wife worth it? \n\nFirst there is the broad category of pride: the singular distinction of loving, and being loved by, an American soldier. Then, golden glimpses so brief, if you blink, you’ll miss them, like the moment you approach a group of soldiers, knowing that your man is among them. Somewhere. You start scanning the crowd. And suddenly, within the uniform, uniformed mass, he appears. Your soldier. Your love. \n\nAs you draw closer, your blood races, each pulsing beat saying, “Mine, mine, mine,” though you know he’s never entirely yours, for the Army has its hold on him, too. But as you come near, he sees you right back and in that brilliant instant of recognition, the guard drops, and there he is, the he of him: the laugh, the posture, the distinguishing quirk. As your gazes hold, maybe he smiles a little, or a lot, and there is a palpable exchange — my heart for yours — made without a single word.\n\nVETERAN’S DAY is our day now. To mark the end of my husband’s 20 years, he had a lavish retirement reception where he received a distinguished-service medal; for my contribution as a wife, I got a certificate framed in plastic. We’re past our last receiving line, past the post-ceremony coffee and cake, when the catering company packs up the china, peels back the table linens, and you’re turned loose to face the next phase together.\n\nA man joins the military because he wants to be part of something larger than himself, and as his wife that  goes for you, too. When he retires, then what are you a part of? The past, I guess. \n\nBut even though his fighting days are over, and he no longer has to salute the flag as it’s rung down on post at dusk, those days live on. That experience, that current of shared history, passes back and forth between us, even when we’re at home, absorbed by the carnage on the screen.\n\nSometimes another movie starts up in my head, unprompted. When my husband is on his back at night, asleep, in the dim blue-gray glow of the clock radio, I see the smooth skin of his neck, the slow rise and fall of his breath, and imagine a bullet cruising neatly through an artery there, the life bubbling out of him, red and dark. I don’t want to cause any pain by telling him. There’s enough in there already at rest, so I keep it to myself. But for me, there is something forever haunting about the throat, and the hand of war around it.\n\nIn the eponymous verse from which the movie’s title is taken, the poet Brian Turner writes about opening the hurt locker to see “what there is of knives and teeth” and to learn “how rough men come hunting for souls.”\n\nTo which I reply: Or don’t.\n\nSince marrying a soldier, I have developed a greater respect for quiet, its limitations and its monumental strength. We’re taught to believe that the truth will set us free, but I also believe that certain facts withheld reveal a truth far greater: That real depth of devotion is proved not by the secrets we’re told but by the decision to shield us from the ones we need not hear. Love articulated by a lexicon of silence. Letting him keep the hurt locker closed."
