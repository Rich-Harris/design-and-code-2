The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended to be more probing than the previous one.\n\nThe idea is that mutual vulnerability fosters closeness. To quote the study’s authors, “One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure.” Allowing oneself to be vulnerable with another person can be exceedingly difficult, so this exercise forces the issue.\n\nThe final task Ms. Catron and her friend try — staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes — is less well documented, with the suggested duration ranging from two minutes to four. But Ms. Catron was unequivocal in her recommendation. “Two minutes is just enough to be terrified,” she told me. “Four really goes somewhere.”\n\nSet I\n\n1.

If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?\n\nSet II\n\n13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?\n\n14. Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time?
