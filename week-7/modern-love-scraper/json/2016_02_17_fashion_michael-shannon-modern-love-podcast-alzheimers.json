  "text": "In this week’s episode of Modern Love: The Podcast (the sixth so far), the actor Michael Shannon (“Boardwalk Empire,” “Take Shelter,” “Revolutionary Road”) reads “A Memory Magically Interrupted” by Robert Leleux.\n\nThe 2009 essay tells the story of a grandmother, “a brunette version of our fellow Texan Ann Richards, who always seemed poised with a staggering, stiletto quip,” whose struggle with Alzheimer’s ends up healing not just, as it would appear, her own health maladies, but also healing her family.\n\nAfterward, the host Meghna Chakrabarti and the Modern Love editor Daniel Jones will catch up with Mr. Leleux to hear what’s happened since the column was published.\n\nHear the other Modern Love podcast episodes (and check out even more Modern Love essays) here."
