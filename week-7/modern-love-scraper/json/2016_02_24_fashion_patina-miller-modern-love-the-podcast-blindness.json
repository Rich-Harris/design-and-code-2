  "text": "Welcome to the seventh installment of Modern Love: The Podcast. This week the actress and Tony Award winner Patina Miller (“Madam Secretary,” “The Hunger Games,” “Pippin” on Broadway) reads “Together Always, in Darkness and in Light” by Nicole C. Kear.\n\nThe 2015 essay tells the story of a woman navigating the challenges of love, marriage and building a family while going blind.\n\nMs. Kear writes of the early days of her relationship: “There is no good way to tell a new guy in your life that you’re going blind. I chose the best of lousy options: I broke the news after sex, and I packaged it right.”\n\nAfterward, the host Meghna Chakrabarti and the Modern Love editor Daniel Jones will catch up with Ms. Kear about what has happened since the column appeared.\n\nHear the other Modern Love podcast episodes (and check out even more Modern Love essays) here."
