  "text": "In the eighth episode of Modern Love: The Podcast, the actress Amber Tamblyn (“The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,” “127 Hours”) reads “Ready to Take a Faithful Leap” by Kelly Thomas.\n\nIn the 2011 essay, a woman learns to love again after a complicated relationship with her mother, who struggled with mental illness, ends in a tragedy inspired by “Thelma & Louise.”\n\n“For me the concept of home is loaded,” she writes. “My childhood home was an isolated farmhouse in North Texas where I helped my father build barbed-wire fences and sack cottonseed for the cattle’s winter feeding, where mesquite trees grew like weeds and yellowed pastures stretched for miles. But most of all, home had been a place dominated by my mother’s unpredictable bouts of depression, a place that, for as long as I could remember, I wanted to escape.”\n\nAfterward, Ms. Thomas and Modern Love editor Daniel Jones share their experiences writing and publishing this column."
